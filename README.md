## Combat Tactics changes
This mod uses Redtide's Adjustments to Combat Tactics mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1422052089). Once you download this repository/extract the Steam Workshop package, you can check out the modified wiki page by opening the combatTacticsMod.html file in the main directory.

## Visual/UI improvement mods that we tested and you can play them together with our mod for your improved comfort:

(Each mod tested for at least 10 years of playtime. If you experience crashes, please comment on our Steam page)

**Theatrum Orbis Terranum**
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=580608756
Looks great, works well, no drop in performance noticed, doesn't change the checksum. Doesn't show you sea zone colors, so don't use if you want to play merchant republic. 

**Bigger hip interface + (optional) Font overhaul** https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=796037673 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1583947680
Keep in mind the min resolution required for bigger hip interface. If the interface is too small for you, you can always try lowering game resolution without any ui mods
(On that note, if you are using multiple screens and need cursor lock, download the autocursorlock https://github.com/James-LG/AutoCursorLock and add ck2 to the processes)

**In heavens graphics overhaul**
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1578835612
All 3 mods in heaven's mods look fine, though there is some file overlap, and you will see purple mountain in byzantium, you can use any of the 3, personally I prefer Theatrum

**Crusader Kings 3 Map Font**
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2235236515

*And again, if you experience crashes using these mods with our mod, or wanna share another visual mod that goes well with our mod, let us know in the comments on our Steam page, please!*
