## Visual/UI improvement mods that we tested you can play together with our mod for your improved comfort:

(each mod tested for at least 10 years playtime, if you experience crashes, please comment on our steam page)

**Theatrum Orbis Terranum**
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=580608756
Looks great, works well, no drop in performance noticed, doesnt change the checksum

**Bigger hip interface + (optional) Font overhaul** https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=796037673 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1583947680
Keep in mind the min resolution required for bigger hip interface. If the interface is too small for you, you can always try lowering game resolution without any ui mods
(on that note if you are using multiple screens and need cursor lock, download the autocursorlock https://github.com/James-LG/AutoCursorLock and add ck2 to the processes)

**In heavens graphics overhaul**
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=580608756
All 3 mods in heaven's mods look fine, though there is some file overlap and you will see purple mountain in byzantium, you can use any of the 3, personally I prefer Theatrum

*And again, if you experience crashes using these mods with our mod, or wanna share another visual mod that goes well with our mod, let us know in the comments on our steam page please!*
