# Permanently inactive (there exists no vanilla code to activate it-- done by title history alone) because of overlap with
# preexisting d_livonian_brothers_of_the_sword. Until we decide what to do with the overlap (e.g., simple retag the latter as
# the former and adjust formation events), it'll remain this way.
