# -*- ck2.traits -*-

# This trait is for any pseudo-character that should always live in the court of Isis. These "characters" tend
# to be more like storage devices. They're the only courtiers spared the wrath of Isis; they are excluded from
# almost everything from which Isis is excluded (plots, etc.) via the emf_isolated_character trigger; they are
# immortal (though custom events to handle their reincarnation are required upon an implementation-dependent
# basis); if they are detected as somehow exiting Isis's court, they will be moved back to it shortly; they
# cannot marry, inherit, or hold any titles.
