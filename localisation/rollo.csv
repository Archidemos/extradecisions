EVTDESCROL.98776;On the shores of northern France, a great Nordic warrior, Hrolfr, also known as Gaange Rolf due to being too heavy to ride a horse, has invaded the northern shores of France and seized land for himself and his Nordic tribesmen. Nordic activity along these shores is not unheard of but Hrolfr's settlement has melded together the Norsemen and local French cultures together resulting in a new designation, the Normans.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCROL.98777;Local Bishops, concerned about paganism in France, have approached me with their obvious desire for me to convert to Christianity.

EVTOPTBROL.98779;We do not need England.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
