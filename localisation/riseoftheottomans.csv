EVTDESCOTT.98700;A young warrior, Osman, has distinguished himself in battles against local nobles. I believe this man could be a valuable Commander and a competent military leader.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTOPTAOTT.98700;His potential bears watching.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESCOTT.98701;My men are restless and my ambitions must no longer be delayed. I must choose a juicy target and call my tribe to war!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTAOTT.98701;Laodikeia is best!.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTBOTT.98701;Ancyra seems natural.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTCOTT.98701;Prusa is rich and weak.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESCOTT.98704;I have fought long and hard for my liege and I have attracted a large, yet loyal, following. Rather than rise up against my old liege, I've decided to strike out for [From.Duchy.GetFullBaseName]. Let [From.Holder.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstName] tremble in fear!;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTOPTAOTT.98704;Saddle my horse!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESCOTT.98705;One of the most capable warriors in the realm, Osman, has gathered a large following of men and has set out declaring his intention to take the [FromFrom.Duchy.GetFullBaseName] from [FromFrom.Holder.TopLiege.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTOPTAOTT.98705;As long as he does not turn on me!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAMEOTT.98706;Rise of the Ottomans!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESCOTT.98706;In Anatolia, a great warrior, Osman, has forged together a realm of his own with the strength of many Turkic tribesmen and refugees., This new force has shifted the balance of power in the region in his favour and he now stands on the verge of forging a mighty empire.;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTOPTAOTT.98706;I'm not done yet.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTBOTT.98706;He is an inspiration to all Turks!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTCOTT.98706;It is simply a petty state owned by a warmongerer, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESCOTT.98707;Turks keep flocking in from all over the region under my banner to help expand this domain even further. Perhaps the Osmanoglu dynasty has a long history ahead of it.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTAOTT.98707;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESCOTT.98708;The great Turkic leader, Osman Osmanoglu, started the great dynasty of his name and lead it to greatness. Now, however, the Osmanoglu's no longer control of their own realm. This has caused a breakdown in loyalties from those who were loyal to the Ottomans and no-one else. As a result, their realm is collapsing in on itself leaving us with little to no measure of control.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAOTT.98708;This is not good.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
