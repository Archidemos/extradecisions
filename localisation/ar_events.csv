EVTNAMEROM.100;West Rome Reborn;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.100;It must be a miracle, after hundereds of years, West Rome has united once more after many hardships from the fall of West Rome to the complete disapearance of the Roman people within Italia. At last the Ruler of Italia has gathered the Roman people and have found its Legitimacy trough them to declare himself Ceasar of West Rome;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.001;Ave, Ceasar!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.101;West Rome Reborn;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.101;After so long, we have finaly claimed the title of Rome trough our legit claim and with the help of the Roman people that we have gathered and resettled within Italia. Now it is time to act against the Byzantines that refused to send proper aid when the west was crumbling. We will demand them to make our claim true and legit!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.002;Send the Envoy!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.003;We dont need their aproval!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.102;An Envoy from Rome;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.102;This is the first time after centuries, an envoy that came from Imperial Rome. After the formation of Rome, it seems that West Rome seeks our approval to their legitimacy. This is redicilous however it might have its benifits to have them arround. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.004;Rome has been reborn!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.005;We shall not help these pretenders!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.103;The Preparation;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.103;Good news, the Byzantines have agreed to acknowledge our claim to Rome and are willing to prepare a coronation for the new born Roman Eagle of the West;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.006;Time to make a proposition with the Byzantines;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.104;The act against the Byzantines;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.104;At last, bad news. The Byzantines have refused our request and called us the pretenders of Rome, this great insult shall not be left away. We have to act, before our claim to Rome will be seen as a mere joke. What shall we do against the Byzantines..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.008;Then we shall take our Eastern part back!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.009;We will make them pay!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.010;There is nothing we can do;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.105;Rome's Claim on their lost lands;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.105;News has spread that the Byzantines have insulted the newly formed Rome and rejected their claim to it. This has angered the Western Roman Empire to the extent where they went on and get a claim on the Byzantine throne, having the excuse they need to perhaps unify the empires together once more..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.011;This could be bad news..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.106;Rome's Revenge on the Byzantines;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.106;News has spread that the Byzantines have insulted the newly formed Rome and rejected their claim to it. This has angered the Western Roman Empire and are now marching towards the Byzantines to make them pay and to Subjugate them by making the Byzantines pay tribute and to also make the Byzantine army pledge to the Roman cause..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.012;Concerning..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.107;The Eagle falls once again;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.107;At last, news has spread that after the Byzantines insuled Rome and rejected their claim. Rome was unable to do anything about it in which at this point their claim is beeing seen as a joke to all the other Euoprean Kingdoms and Empires alike. This has put a mark on the newly formed Empire and make them unconditionally relinquish their title and claim to Rome completly..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.013;Peace at last!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.108;Unification of Rome;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.108;While preparing for the Coronation of the Western Romans, their ruler has presented us a proposal. They are aware that the Muslims in the east always caused trouble to the Byzantines and they also know that they could become a bigger threat in the future. Hence why the Western Roman Emperor has proposed a Union between the two, they claim that perhaps restoring Rome would be the best thing to do in order to restore Rome's Glory once more. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.014;We shall unite once more, for Rome!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.015;How about we pledge with our wealth and power only..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.016;This is outrageous, we refuse!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.109;Rome United once more;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.109;It has happend, after more than 200 years the two Roman eagles have finally decided to reunite their borders and reform Rome to its former glory. To some this is amazing news while for the others, this might be very concerning. Who will be able to stop the Roman Eagle..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.017;May the strongest survive...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.110;Roman-Byzantine Cooperation;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.110;It seems that there was an attempt to restore the borders of the Roman Empire again, however this did not succeed. The Byzantines claimed that they simply cannot just give in to the Romans like that. However they did pledge their wealth and army to the Roman cause. Rome has many enemies even untill today, and this semi-union can cause great things for the Romans. However it does seem that this will cause future problem for when they perhaps are thinking on restoring Rome...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.018;God have mercy..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.111;Western Roman Victory;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.111;The news has spread everywhere in Europe, the Western Roman Empire has won a decisive war against the Byzantines. The Western Romans were able to march towards Constantinople and press their demands onto the Byzantines Emperor. Now all the Byzantines can do is follow their demands and give in to the new Western Roman Empire;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.019;This is bad..;;;;;;;;;x


EVTDESCisldecadent2;As you have woken up, you realise that got your old decadent urges again that led you to your old bad habbits.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.112;The fall of Western Rome;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.112;Rumors say that the newly formed Western Roman Empire has lost a decisive battle against the Byzantines, leaving the Western Roman Empire with nothing. This means that the Byzantines now are freely able to march onto Rome and making the Romans lose their claim. At last the Roman Crisis has been resolved in Byzantine Dominance. All the Western Roman Empire can do now is to give in to the Byzantine demands and lose their Empire once more. This time however, by their own Roman brother in the east..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.020;Europe is safe once more..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.113;The Legion of Italica;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.113;After the formation of this new §YWestern Roman Empire§!, it seems that the Emperor of Rome has decided to recreate a Legion. This Legion seems to be only loyal to the Emperor and could potentialy be dangerous as they are one of the most elite units of the §YWestern Roman Empire§!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.021;Concerning news indeed...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.114;The Envoy to Germania;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.114;It is perhaps wise to have a talk with the Holy Roman Emperor. After all, they claim themselfs to be Roman and even Holy, as much as a joke this is, we will have to put our foot down. The envoy is ready to be sent;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.022;Send the Envoy!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.115;The Western Roman Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.115;An envoy from the Western Roman Empire has arrived, it seems that they demanded us to give up and destory the title of Holy Roman Emperor. As much of a insult this is to us, we have to consider our people as well. This war could end up very bloody weither we win or lose. What shall we do..?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.023;We have no choice but to agree..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.024;These Romans are making me laugh!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.116;The Emperor agrees;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.116;At last, The Holy Roman Emperor has come with the envoy we have sent. It seems that the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire is prepared to give up his title to us. This is great news as the faith of the Holy Roman Empire is in our hands, but we know what we will do about this pretentious title!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.025;At last, The Holy Roman Empire no more!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.117;The Emperor refuses!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.117;The Envoy has come back empty handed. It seems that the Emperor is not willing to give in to our demand. Perhaps we should think about our next action as the Holy Roman Empire is no joke, they are a mighty German Empire that should not be underestimated. What shall we do about the pretenders..?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.026;Then war it is!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.027;Perhaps this is not smart..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.118;The Fallen Pretenders;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.118;The rumors were true. It seems that the Holy Roman Empire exists no longer. After the defeat of the Holy Roman Army, Western Rome was able to march on to the Imperial Capital of the Empire with little resistance. From the throne room, the Western Roman Emperor has at last disolved the Holy Roman Empire;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.028;Gone with the Germans!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.119;Holy Roman Victory;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.119;How humiliating. Rumors go that the Western Roman Empire lost against the Holy Roman Empire, after the West Romans have sent a deligation towards the Holy Roman Empire to disolve the Title of the Holy Roman Empire. After the Emperor refused, Western Rome went to war but lost at last against the Holy Roman Empire. This is truly a shame for the Roman Emperor;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.029;The embarrasment..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.120;The Western Roman Usurpation;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.120;This is unheard of. The Holy Roman Empire has traveled to Rome to meet up with the Western Roman Emperor. Rumor goes that the Holy Roman Emperor has given their titles to the Western Roman Emperor in which they have disolved and destroyed the title of the Holy Roman Empire. Perhaps the Holy Roman Emperor had good reasonings behind this but this is a shame to the Germans and the Catholic world;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.030;Roman no longer..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.121;The Aftermath;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.121;Sire, we have finally beaten the Holy Roman Empire. For so long, they have been claiming to be the sucessor to Rome but thanks to you. Their claims are no longer valid, we truly are the Heirs of the Roman Empire now.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.031;Show me the plunder!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEILKH108;The Qara Qoyunlu approaches..;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCILKH108;We have got bad news, it seems that our rival clan, the Qara Qoyunlu is attempting to take down our empire by declaring a full scale invasion on us. This is grim news and we have to stop them at once!;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIMEOPT10;To War!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMETIME111;The Qara Qoyunlu;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIME111;Word goes arround that the mighty Timurids got defeated by the newly risen horde of the Qara Qoyunlu. This horde originated from the Timurids and figured to grab a chance at toppling the Timurid Empire, and it seems that they succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIMEOPT11;Awfull!;;;;;;;;;;;x

ILKHOPT3;Let them settle at last..;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEGOL105;The Mongol State of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGOL105;Russia is a massive piece of land with many kinds of people living within it. This however did not stop the Golden Horde to conquer the lands. However, it proves to even the Golden Horde to be too much to control. Hence why the Golden Horde decided to release the Empire of Russia under the control of the Golden Horde. This could be a great way to mobilize the army in Russia and call them in any conflict that the Golden Horde may be in. Regardless of this benefit, this could act as a double-edged sword as the Russians could easily turn away from the Golden Horde. Only time will tell what will happen further in the Russian lands;;;;;;;;;;;x

GOLDOPT1;Wonderfull;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMETIME105;The City of Half of the World;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIME105;We have at last reached the City of Half of the World, Esfahan. A Magnificent city with quite the beauty. Too bad that we will have to continue our march to reunify the Empire of the Mongols. We do have a choice however, we can keep our traditions and stay the way we are, or use Esfahan as a base for our new reformed Empire and Feudalize to the Iqta ways. If we Feudalize, we are able to make better use of the urbanized cities of the Middle East to our advantage, from getting more finances to being able to mobilize the local armies. This however means, abandoning our traditional way of living. What shall we choose?;;;;;;;;;;;x

TIMEOPT1;We will follow the way of Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIMEOPT2;We will keep our traditions and move forward!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMETIME106;The Timurids settles in Persia;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIME106;Releaving news, it seems that after the Timurids have reached Esfahan, they have started to feudalize and adopted the Iqta way of governing lands. This means that they abandoned their Mongolic and Barbaric ways of conquering and are perhaps more pacified. This however doesnt mean that they will just stop from Persia... or perhaps they will. Only time will tell what Timurds will do as their leader, Timur the Lame can be a monster. Perhaps he changed his ways, only God can show ur mercy now..;;;;;;;;;;;x

TIMEOPT3;May Timur find peace now;;;;;;;;;;;x


MOGGOLDOPT1;Very well, for the sake of Tengri;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOGGOLDOPT2;Never, the are traitors forever!;;;;;;;;;;;x

MOGGOLDOPT3;Currious..;;;;;;;;;;;x

MOGGOLDCLASH.100;Golden Horde Envoy;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOGGOLDCLASHDESC.100;Great Khan, we have recived a envoy from our Mongolian brothers of the west. The Golden Horde wishes to make peace with you. It seems that they are offering as far as tribute to you as long as we promise to aid them whenver they are in dire need and to not attack them. What shall we respond with Great Khan?;;;;;;;;;;;x

MOGGOLDCLASH.101;Mongolic-Golden Horde Pact;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOGGOLDCLASHDESC.101;As the two massive Hordes are laying waste to the lands of the World. There has been contact between the Golden Horde and the Mongol Empire. It seems that they are related to eachother and therefore wish to keep the peace between the two Empires. In order for that to happen, the Golden Horde agreed to pledge some of their treasury and income to the Mongol Empire, in exchange of eternal peace. This is be catastrophic for Europe as now, the Golden Horde, already on the footsteps of Europe are now able to conquer and raze freely without having to worry about the Mongols.;;;;;;;;;;;x

MOGILLCLASH.100;Ilkhanate Envoy;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOGILLCLASHDESC.100;Great Khan, we have recived a envoy from our Mongolian brothers from Persia. The Ilkhanate also wishes to make peace with you. It seems that they are offering as far as tribute to you as long as we promise to aid them whenver they are in dire need and to not attack them. What shall we respond with Great Khan?;;;;;;;;;;;x

MOGILLCLASH.101;Mongolic-Ilkhanate Horde Pact;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOGILLCLASHDESC.101;As the Ilkhanate, being related to the Mongol Empire also have the goald to lay waste to the world to assert Tengri dominations towards the lands the Ilkhanate conquers. Because of this ambition, there has been contact between the Ilkhanate and the Mongol Empire. It seems that the Mongol Empire admire the ambitions of the Ilkhanate and therefore wish to keep the peace between the two Empires. In order for that to happen, the Ilkhanate agreed to pledge some of their treasury and income to the Mongol Empire, in exchange of eternal peace. This is be catastrophic for Anatolia and the Balkans and maybe for Europe in the futureas now, the Ilkhanate have free regin to conquer and raze freely without having to worry about the Mongols.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEILKH105;The City of Peace;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCILKH105;Long have we traveled trough-out Asia, we have seen many thing. From our homeland in Mongolia, we traveled to the India where we have seen the Elephants and their culture all the way to where we are now, Persia. Within Persia there are so many beautifull things about it like the culture and their prized city, Baghdad. Perhaps it is time to make a decision. We could choose to keep the prosperous and rich city of Baghdad, the "City of Peace" and start settling arround the area to assert our presence to prosper and perhaps keep peace. However we could also choose to keep going west and continue practicing our traditions by staying Nomadic and lay waste to the whole world in the name of Tengri...;;;;;;;;;;;x

ILKHOPT1;It is time to stay in Persia;;;;;;;;;;;x
ILKHOPT2;On wards, to Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEILKH106;The Ilkhanate settles in Iraq;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCILKH106;We recieved gladning news in Persia, word goes that the Ilkhanate, a group of Nomads that has seperated from the Mongol Empire to help out with laying waste and its conquest, have finally decided to settle in Persia. This was announced in their new capital of Baghdad, where they will consolidate their influence, religion and power over all of Persia. However, this does not mean that they will stop there. However, this does tame the Mongolian Horde of the Ilkhanate quite alot. We shall hope that this is the last time we will hear from them..;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTNAMEROMA97;Strange Red Fleet Spotted;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMA97;A very strange sight has been spotted, it seems that across the Atlantic Ocean, a massive fleet has been spotted by Nordic and English Merchant Ships. This is very weird since we always knew that part of the Ocean to be the End of the World, where the ocean would flood down to the void. Perhaps... there is land out there, or worse. Who knows where this fleet came from, however the biggest concern is that it is slowly approaching Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROMA99;Golden Eagles on the Horrizon;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMA99;As months have passed, English scouts and traveling Merchant Ships have been able to take a closer look at the fleet. We got told that the ships seems to be using red sails with mostly a yellow eagles on it. While the ships themselfs look not from this time. Its like the ships that were build in Ancient Rome... This is not making up as the Roman Empire have been disintregrated for centuries now. Whatever waits on those ships dont look too friendly as within the ship, they seem to be armed and weaponized. This is very concerning.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROMA100;The Roman Invasion for England;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMA100;At last, these fantasized warriors that were across the sea within the ships are actual Romans. There is massive confusion within the whole of Europe since this is not making sense. Theories are already being made like this being the Wrath of God, or that these are Warriors from an Unknown World.. The only logical explanation given by historians and our wise people seems to be that perhaps during the Fall of the Roman Empire, they fled with the leftover ships towards whereever they came from and now came back for revenge. Eitherway they seem to want to have a fight and we must stop these Romans before it is too late!;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTTOOLTIPIsls.005;The Great Islamic Schism has been mended and all of Islam is united once more under one faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEIsls.005;The Islamic Schism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIsls.005;For a long time, The Muslims were always split in two major sects, the Sunnis and the Shiites. For long there there were many arguments and conflicts between the two. However, today marks a special day within the Islamic World. From this day forward the Caliphate has proclaimed and enforced a Islamic Schism towards the Sunni Muslims. They will have to either submit to the Shiite faith or to continue their heretical ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEIsls.006;The choice of Submission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIsls.006;Now that the Caliph has unified the different warring sects of Islam that have been split since the death of Mohammed, He has presented an ultimatum to the rulers of the other Islamic sects, we either to convert to the new dominant faith, or we fall to his new proclaimed era of Jihad. Either way, the future of our Realm is in our hands, what do we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIsls.001;Peace at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIsls.005;We are with the Schism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIsls.006;No, the Caliph is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

UNIINAME1000;Islam is united;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UNIIDESC1000;At last Islam has been united once more after the many Caliphates before like the Rashudin Caliphate and the Umayyad Calipahte. This is concerning new for the other faiths as the Muslims united their banners once more. Who knows what this newly formed Caliphate will do next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUnii.001;At last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ARCNAME1000;The Timurids;;;;;;;;;x
ARCDESC1000;Another great Khan is on the rise in Central Asia. Timur, called 'the Lame' due to his clubfoot, has proven himself to the Turco-Mongol tribes of the region. He seems intent on creating an empire to rival that of the legendary Genghis Khan himself. Tens of thousands of skilled horsemen have gathered under his banner!;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECATSCM.100;The Catholic Schism;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCATSCM.100;At last, it seems the Christians have finally settled their problems ever since the Papacy has conquered and reconverted the holy provinces of Orthodoxy and subjugating the Orthodox Patriarchy. The news says that after the conquests and conversions of these provinces, the Papacy finally had the power and control needed to end the Catholic Schism and send out envoys to any Orthodox ruler with the approval of the disolved Patriarchy to join the true Christian Faith;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCATSCM.001;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECATSCM.001;The Catholic Schism;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCATSCM.001;Your Holiness, we have finished the preperations. We are now ready to send envoys to every known Orthodox ruler to make them submit to the Holy See and become Christian.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCATSCM.002;Excelent, spread the word!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEUIN.001;India United;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUIN.001;After many wars and battles the Indian people had to go trough, at last India is united under one ruler;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUIN.001;This is concerning..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEUIN.002;A New Era for India;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUIN.002;We at last have united India under our banner, now that everyone in India is bowing down to our might, we have to make sure to have total control over our people. This can only be done by making them submit to the one true faith we belive in;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUIN.002;Send the message!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEUIN.003;The Diplomat from the Capital;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUIN.003;Word has been out that the Ruler of all of India has been sending diplomats to all our neigbours including us for a final act of religious submission, what shall we tell to the messenger..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUIN.003;At last!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTUIN.005;We shall submit to his faith..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTUIN.006;We refuse this demand!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEUIN.004;The Indian Crusade;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUIN.004;For long, the Christians in India have been reduced by size cause of their rulers following their own religions. However after the formation of the new Christian Kingdom in South India, the time for the Indians to strike against the different faiths has come. In the name of God, they will start an Crusade against all of India.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUIN.007; May God bless them!;;;;;;;;;x


EVTNAMEIsls.002;The Envoy from the Papacy;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIsls.002;My Liege, we have recieved an envoy from the Holy See. It seems that the problems between our faith and the Chrisitan faith has been settled, it even has the both the seals of the Papay and the Patriarchy. It must be true then... They are requesting for us to give up on our faith and join the Catholic Faith as the Patriarch also aproved this. Sire, what shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCATSCM.003;We shall go with our Patriarch;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCATSCM.004;We will never abandon our faith!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECATSCM.003;The End of the Orthodox Schism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCATSCM.003;This is the end of an era. The Holy See has recently won a decicive victory against the Orthodox Patriarch and the Orthodox World. The Pope has marched onto Constantinople and have made their demands to finally put an end to the Schism and reunite with the Holy See, making the Patriarch obsolete. This is a big day for the Catholic world, a dream come true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCATSCM.005;Peace at last;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECATSCM.004;The Defeat of the Holy See
EVTDESCCATSCM.004;News has spread that the Holy See has been defeated after they could not buldge the might of the Orthodox Crusaders against the Papacy. The Catholic will enter a dark age, an age where it seems that the two churches will never be united and stay seperated for good.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECATSCM.005;The Crusade on Orthodoxy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCATSCM.005;Your Holiness, the preperations are as good as ready. This will be one of the grandest wars Europe will ever see, even God will look at us from His Throne. It is time to put an end to this Orthodox Schism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCATSCM.010;Declare the Crusade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCATSCM.011;I changed my mind, no need for bloodshed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECATSCM.006;The Invasion of the Holy See;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCATSCM.006;Sire, we have heard that the Holy See has started a war on the Eastern Roman Empire and the Patriarch to put an end to the Christian Schism that has been going on for ages. This will truly be a Conflict of the World in which perhaps God will watch from Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCATSCM.006;The Humanity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECATSCM.007;An Request from the Holy See;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCATSCM.007;The recent news must be true, the Papacy has at last declared war on the Eastern Roman Empire and the Orthodox Patriarchy to end the Schism between the two churches. However, it seems that they are asking for our help in this conflict. What shall we respond to the Papacy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCATSCM.007;We shall go to arms in the name of the Holy See
EVTOPTCATSCM.008;We shall stay Neutral in this conflict

EVTNAMECATSCM.008;The Papal Invasion on Orthodox Christianity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCATSCM.008;Concerning news my liege. We have spotted a massive crusader army headed towards our direction. The news says that the Papacy has declared on the Eastern Roman Empire to destroy Orthodoxy. Our faith is in danger and we have to act, what shall we do?
EVTOPTCATSCM.009;We shall defend the Patriarch

EVTTITLERUSKI.001;Russia is reforming;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCRUSKI.001;At last, as the Russian people have finally been united. It is time for the Russian Emperor to reform the Administration of the Empire. Russia exsists with many religions and cultures and is almost impossible to manage with our current bureaucracy. Hence the time for Russian Reform has come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTRUSKI001;Ura, Ura, Ura!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLERUSKI.002;Russia's Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCRUSKI.002;As the Russians have united, they have found oppertunity to expand their influence inside Asia, trough Siberia. Who knows what Russia will find far East of Asia. What can be certain is that this will be a bloody expansion eastwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTRUSKI002;May God have mercy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMUG100;The Mughals;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMUG100;A new threat rises up in India, with the goal to unite India under the banner of the Mughal Dynasty in the name of Babur Khan and in the name of Allah. Babur Khan is doing this to suceed what the Timurids and Genghis Khan could not do, to conquer India and then the world. This could be bad news if they were to reach Europe..;;;;;;;;;x

HREARNAME1;The Imperial Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HREDESC1;At last, your father Louis the Pious has died after living a longer life then most people in the World. You now have to decide what to do with the Empire. You can perhaps assume control over Louis's Throne and keep his Empire together or you could shatter the Holy Roman Empire and let your brother go. What shall we do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTHREAR.1;It is time to end this Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHREAR.2;Louis's Legacy shall live on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HREARNAME2;Louis's Legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HREDESC2;You have decided to keep the Empire together, as much as this is preferable to maintain your current power. This will anger your brothers and vassals alike, therefore you will have to deal with a few problems that the Empire will bring with you. Either you maintain control, or you will splinter at last. May God be on your side, Louis will be watching from Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHREAR.5;In the name of God, Louis and Charlemagne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HREARNAME3;The Crown of Louis Shattered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HREDESC3;It is no suprise that Louis's Empire would end when he would die. Louis lived a long life which is unheard of, however at last he lost his life. After the Crown passed to his Son, it seems that the Ambitious King has decided to Dismantle the Empire that his Father and Grandfather have build. Therefore, The Holy Roman Empire is gone... but for how long..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHREAR.3;Europe is restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HREARNAME4;The Imperial Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HREDESC4;This has come to a suprise to everyone in Europe. It seems that after the death of Louis the Pious, his son would keep the title of Holy Roman Emperor. This could bring a whole lot of conflicts as all the Kingdoms within the Holy Roman Empire is held by his brothers which are very displeased of this succession. Only time will tell what will happen to this Ancient Empire that has lasted after the Collapse of the Roman Empire. Perhaps, there is a small chance that his son could stabilize the Empire and deal with the internal conflicts. Only time will tell what will happen to the empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHREAR.4;Hah, there is no chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HREARNAME12;Imperial Crisis averted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HREDESC12;This is unbelievable. News has spread that the Holy Roman Empire has resolved their crisis and stabalized everything within the Empire. It seems like the Empire of Charlemagne will stand tall after all. If Louis the Pious were to be alive, he would surely be proud of his grandchildren. While they rejoice, the rest of Europe watches with evny and fear as this massive Empire will surely last troughout the ages. God only knows what their next ambition is;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HREARNAME10;The Barbaric Invasion on Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEBBR100;The Umayyad Invasion of Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBBR100;This is unbelivable, we tought the Umayyads to be finished many years ago. However, word spreads that the Umayyads gathered some forces and has declared a Invasion on Spain, just like Tariq ibn Ziyad. The Berber that invaded Spain for the Umayyad Caliphate back at the Islamic Golden Age. This could be a problem for the Spanish Reconquistadors as this big force is now uppon them. Will they be able to hold them off, it seems impossible but who knows...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

UMMNAME7;Christian Invasion on the Umayyads;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UMMDESC7;Horrible news my liege. It seems that an Crusader army has arrived in our lands from the south. While we were solving our internal matters, i assume they took the oppertunity to take our lands. However, we will not stand for this, we shall defeat them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPUMM.7;Just a bunch of Crusaders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

UMMNAME6;The Crisis of Muslim Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UMMDESC6;For a while now, the Umayyad Caliphate is on a decline in Spain ever since their Golden Age ended. While the Spanish take good advantage of the sittuation in the Calipahte. Perhaps there is hope and this crisis can be averted, but time will only tell what the rulers of the Dynasty will do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPUMM.6;We shall watch on;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

UMMNAME5;The Hope for Islam;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UMMDESC5;This is unbelivable, it seems that the Umayyad Dynasty has mediated their internal crisis and are now standing stronger than ever. This could be a big problem for the Spannish Christians that always exploited the internal problems that the Umayyads had before. Who knows what the Umayyads will do next, now that they are united and strong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEPOPE.8;The Empire of God;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOPE.8;With divine inspiration, the Pope establishes the Empire of God. In a sacred ceremony, he assumes both earthly and spiritual leadership. The faithful rejoice, pilgrims seek divine grace, and a new chapter unfolds in history. Will this divine realm stand firm or face the challenges of mortal politics?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTPOPE.8;At last!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCPOPE.1;It seems that the Holy See has sent an envoy to our court, They demand us to change our law to Papal Investiture. If we agree, the Pope would reward us and have their gratitude. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTPOPE.1;We shall abide with what the Holy See commands;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTPOPE.2;I rule these lands, not the Papacy. We will refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCPOPE.2;Good news your Holiness. It seems that the realm of who you requested Papal Investiture has accepted your request. We shall send an envoy to reward them apropriatly;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTPOPE.3;Deus eos benedicat!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCPOPE.3;Bad news your Holiness. It seems that the realm of who you requested Papal Investiture has refused our request. This is very unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTPOPE.4;This defies God!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCPOPE.4;Your Holiness. We have recently gained an envoy from a ruler that wishes to gain a blessing from the Holy See. How shall we respond to this?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTPOPE.5;We shall bless them;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTPOPE.6;We refuse their request;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTPOPE.7;How blasphemous of them to ask!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCPOPE.6;My Liege, bad news. We have been told that the Papacy denied our request for a blessing. This is a bad day for us...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTPOPE.9;Unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCPOPE.7;My Liege, troubling news. We have gained an envoy back from the Holy See in which it stated that our request is an insult to the Papacy and so the Christian world, in which the Pope has excomunicated you..;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMETRIB.1;An Envoy from our Overlord;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTRIB.1;Sire, we have some grim news. It seems that the envoy sent here from our Overlord has a message about the Annexation of these realms. It seems that our Overlord wishes us to continue ruling our realm but within his grasp. He wishes that we join his realm while keeping the land we own. This means that we will be integrated within his realm. Perhaps this could be a good thing as we are easier able to grow within his realm, however this also means that we will lose our Independence. What shall we do now?;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTTRIB.1;Very well, we shall cooperate;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTRIB.2;This is insane, never!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMETRIB.2;A Rebelious Subject;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTRIB.2;Sire, we got concerning news. We have just recieved the envoy of our Subject and they declare to not be incorperated and goes against your wishes. If we do not act, this means that they will become free of our grasp... unless you put this rebelion down at once. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTTRIB.3;They will bow down to me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTRIB.4;We got no choice;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMETRIB.3;Independence;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTRIB.3;Good news sire, our envoy has just returned with news that our Overlord has decided to let us go. This means that we are Independent once again.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.117;Nordic Invasion on the Holy Roman Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.117;We have come far and expanded wide into Europe, however one problem remains. It is the Holy Roman Empire, right now they are our rival on European Dominance and we have to act on this potential threat. Perhaps it is wise to strike now and strike hard to make the Holy Roman Empire dissolve their title. However we could also focus our efforts at home and instead build up the lands we have conquered. What is wise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.019;Death to the Holy Roman Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.020;Perhaps building up is the right choice..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.118;Holy Roman Reinformcements;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.118;Your Imperialness, news has arrived from our garrisons that the North Sea Empire has started an invasion on us. This is grim news, this has made your Marshal gather units to the capital and are ready to serve you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.021;Reinforcements have arrived!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.119;Nordic Victory on the Holy Roman Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.119;It seems that the North Sea Empire has won against the Holy Roman Empire, they have taken the title and disolved it. Disolving the Holy Roman Empire as a whole, no more will their be a German Powerhouse in Europe. It seems that the only strong force left is the North Sea Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.022;This is bad..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.120;Holy Roman Victory on the North Sea Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.120;At last, it seems like the North Sea Empire could not made a desisive victory against the Holy Roman Empire. Therefore they have retreated back to their lands making sure that they will never do such thing again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.023;Peace at last..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.121;Our Victory on the Holy Roman Empire
EVTDESCCEL.121;We have done it. The Holy Roman Empire is no longer, this was a costly and exhausting war but the payoff is wonderfull as now there is no longer a threat for us in Europe. We now dominate Europe and its seas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.024;May we prosper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.109;The North Sea Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.109;Many vikings have dreamed on exploring the world and what is beyond it. With this ambition, the Vikings from the North have finally conquered England and therefore united their tribes under one banner and proclaimed the North Sea Empire, this could be bad for any cilivized monarch that wants to prosper as these savage raiders will show no mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.014;Concerning..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.110;The Varangian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.110;News has spread that the vikings of the north have finaly united their tribes with the tribes of their ancestors that has colonized the Rus. Proclaiming the Empire of the Varingians. This is concerning news as they can now reach Persia with their raiders and has easier access to the Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.015;This is a problem..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.111;Norse Ambitions on France;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.111;It seems like after the conquest of England, the Norse claims that France also belongs to the North Sea Empire in which they have perhaps plans on invading the French lands. Who knows if they will or will not invade France with the gathered forces they have gotten. Time will only tell when they are going to press the claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.016;Good Grief..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.112;The Invasion on the Byzantines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.112;It is finally time to prepare for the Great War against the Byzantines. After many struggles, we can finally undo what our ancestors have done. Shall we go on with the plan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.017;Death to the Byzantines!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.018;Maybe we should develop our lands isntead..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.113;The Dissolution of the Byzantines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.113;Shocking news has arrived. The Varingian Empire has destroyed the Byzantine Empire after a devistating defeat on the Byzantines. The Varingians were able to march up to Constantinople and disolved a decendent of the Roman Empire. At last, it seems the Roman Eagle has finally fallen for good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.019;No more Romans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.114;The Spoils of War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.114;My Liege, this war has been a glorious one. Defeating one of the decendants of the Roman Empire. Everyone in Europe talks off us and as shocked of this news. At last, we have brought you the spoils of war after we have pillaged the City of the World's Desire. We would like to present you these spoils as a sign of respect to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.020;I thank you my subject;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.115;The Varangians Retreat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.115;Word has spread that the Varingian Empire, despite their numeric advantages have lost against the Byzantine Empire. It seems that the Byzantines are not to be messed with, despite their many teretorial losses. It seems that the Varingians are now retreating back to Russia with humiliation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.021;Barbarians as always..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.100;The Rise of the Celtics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.100;For the first time after the Fall of Gaul, caused by the Roman Empire and having to endure many years of suffering. The Celtics has finally risen as a proper Empire under one ruler united with it's people. Things could get sour since the Celtics could perhaps try to find revenge for their suffering. Only time will tell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.001;At last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.101;The Celtic Issue on the Papacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.101;We have finally reconquered Gaul from the many Kingdoms that hold the lands, this will be the beginning of a New Era for the Celtics. However, it is perhaps time to pay a visit to the Holy See and press our demands on to the Pope. No longer will we be opressed or intimidated and under the Papal Mandate. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.002;Send an diplomat to the Papacy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.003;Perhaps revenge is not the answer..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.102;The Celtic Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.102;Your Holiness. A Diplomat from the Celitc Empire has arived. They are talking about a Ultimatum to surrender the Holy See to the Celtics and they require an answer from you. What shall we respond with?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.004;We refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.005;For the sake of Peace..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.103;The Insular Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.103;This is a dark day. It seems that after discussion with the Holy See, The Papacy has for some reason agreed to the demands of the Celtic Empire and the Insular Church to give up on Rome and grant the former lands of the Papacy to the Insular Church. This truly is a grim day for the Catholic World....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.006;The Holy See has abandoned us..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.104;The Papcy refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.104;Bad news my Liege. As expected, the Holy See refused our demands and calls them outragious. What shall we do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.007;Spread the word, we are marching to Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.008;On a seccond tought..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.105;The Celitc War against the Holy See;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.105;Since the Celitc Empire has fully conquered the Kingdoms of France, Aquitaine and Arles. Tensions have risen between the Celtic Empire and the Papacy. However, war has been delcared on the Papacy to usurp the Papal States as the Celtic Empire claims that the Catholic Church is corrupt and needs to be reformed. This could be a war not to be forgotten for many generations to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.009;Good Grief..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.106;The Holy Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.106;Concerning news, it seems that the Holy See is at war against the Celtic Empire. It looks like the Celtic Empire wants to usurp the Papacy and install the Insular Church on Rome. This could be bad for Catholicism. However, this could be a chance to dethrone the Papacy and perhaps look to embrace Insular Catholicism... What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.010;Gone with the Holy See!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.011;We cannot abandon the Pope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.012;We got bigger problems right now..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.107;The Insulars beat Catholicism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.107;This has been a exhausting war but at last the Celtic Insular belivers came on top and has won this major war against the Holy See. This perhaps will leave a permanent scar on the Catholic world. Especially since now the Papacy had to flee from their palace and find residence in another realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.012;Peace at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.108;The Papal Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.108;This has been a exhausting war but it seems that the Insular Celtic Empire has lost against the Holy See and the Catholic World. This will forever weaken the Insular faith and withdraws from Catholic and Papal affairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.013;Good Grief..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DTCHNAME1;The Dutch Unification;;;;;;;;;;x
DTCHDESC1;After conquering the lowlands and uniting the Netherlands, the people are desperate to know who their ruler will be. We could establish a Dutch Kingdom to apease the Orangeists.

HUINGENAME1;A United Germania;;;;;;;;;;;x
UINGEDESC1;Concerning news, it is almost unbelivable. It seems that the Germans are united under one banner, the banner of the Black Raven. The Germans are well known for their fierce yet genius fighting skills. Having them all under one banner could face a big threat to us. At last, the Legacy of Ludwig the German moves on, Only time will tell how big of a threat they realy will become.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HUINGENAME2;A United England;;;;;;;;;;;x
UINGEDESC2;The British Isles has been trough alot these few decades. From simple raiders to invaders trying to take the land for themselfs, however it seems that the people in England are finally united under one banner. the banner of the Golden Lion. This is quite concerning as the British Isles has its diverse yet dangerous inventions and warriors. From the Longbow Archers to its Celtic neighbours. Time will only tell what their next move will be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMERASHD1;The Kingdom has been Conquered;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCRASHD1;Glory to the Caliphate, we have conquered the enemy's Kingdom. Now we march forward to our next target, to bring them into the fold of Islam and the Caliphate;;;;;;;;;;;x

ANNORASHD.100;The Islamic Conquest of Iraq;;;;;;;;;;;x
ANNORASHDDESC.100;It seems that the newly risen Caliphate for the religion called Islam have beaten the mighty Sassanid and Eastern Roman Empire in one battle. Just who are these warriors in the Middle East.... Nevertheless, it seems that they have therefore conqurered the Kingdom of Iraq and started converting the populus to the faith of Islam;;;;;;;;;;;x

ANNORASHD.101;The Ghassanids have been defeated;;;;;;;;;;;x
ANNORASHDDESC.101;Without catching a break, it seems that the Ghassanids have been defeated. They have been recent friends of the Eastern Roman Empire and have always gotten aid from them. However, the Eastern Roman Empire have been defeated yet again. Now that the Middle Eastern desert have fell into the hands of the Rashudin Caliphate, they now have opened the gates to the Levant for an imminent invasion;;;;;;;;;;;x

ANNORASHD.102;The Islamic Conquest of Jerusalem;;;;;;;;;;;x
ANNORASHDDESC.102;With the rapid conquest of the Rashudin Caliphate and the swift defeats of the well-known might Empires, they have hence secured and conquered the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Victory after victory, this is alarmingly concerning. At this rate, no one can defeat them except God. If Christianity is about worshipping God, then why does God help this Islamic Caliphate with all of these miraculous-like victories...;;;;;;;;;;;x

ANNORASHD.110;The Final Stretch towards Hispania;;;;;;;;;;;x
ANNORASHDDESC.110;Indeed, from where this was seen as a major raid towards the Eastern Roman Empire. It now seems that this new Empire or Caliphate has conquered their way to the Kingdom of Spain. Surely, at some point, even for this miraculous-like Empire, there is a breaking point for having this much land... Their Empire extends from the Gates of India all the way to the Heart of Hispania. Perhaps this marks as the end of the Conquest, or maybe they will conquer deeper into Europe... Only time will tell what the Caliphate will do next...;;;;;;;;;;;x

ANNORASHD.111;The Islamic Conquest of Khorasan;;;;;;;;;;;x
ANNORASHDDESC.111;With the rapid conquest of the Rashudin Caliphate and the swift defeats of the well-known might Empires, they have hence secured and conquered the Kingdom of Khorasan.

If Christianity is about worshipping God, then why does God help this Islamic Caliphate with all of these miraculous-like victories...;;;;;;;;;;;x

ANNORASHD200;The Caliphate is repeled;;;;;;;;;;;x
ANNORASHDDESC200;As figured, this newly risen Caliphate in Arabia got beaten after the Sassanids and the Eastern Roman Empire formed a Coalition against these Arabian Raiders after they have launched a massive invasion against both Empires. It seems like the Eastern Roman Empire also went ahead and established a Orthodox Kingdom in Arabia to assert full dominance in Arabia so that these kind of Invasions will never happen again..;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMERASHD112;A Fitna begins;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCRASHD112;Grim News, we have heard that the alarmingly powerfull dynasty, the Umayyads have at last started a Islamic Civil War against us to overthrow our holy dynasty that has been appointed by the people. We must defeat the Umayyads at once!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCRASHD114;Bad News, it seems that our recently banished free-man called Abu Muslim have gathered quite the support in Persia to start a rebellion against us.

DESC_NOR1;With the invasion of England by the Norsemen we have found ourselves settled on the lands of the Saxons. Ever since we departed from Scandinavia many brave warriors came along to find fame and riches, however there were also men who found their way onto the land that the Saxons had left behind. Finding ourselves in a period of peace we have decided to officially form the Danelaw on the lands that we first made contact with. \n \nNot so long after settling down have our men gone around and pillaged Britannia and beyond, finding themselves kidnapping many slaves. Some even find true love in their property and are embracing certain traditions that the Saxons once used to practice on these lands.
