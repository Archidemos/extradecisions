germanic_pagan_DESC;The old faith of the Germanic tribes venerates a pantheon led by powerful gods such as Wodan, Donar, and Frigg. Warriors seek the favor of the gods through courage, oathkeeping, and blood sacrifice, believing that glory in battle ensures a place in the halls of the honored dead. Sacred groves, runic rites, and seasonal festivals bind the community together in devotion to the old ways, resisting the encroachment of foreign faiths.;;;;;;;;;x

nicene_christian_DESC;Founded on the teachings of Jesus Christ and the doctrine defined at the First Council of Nicaea, this faith proclaims one God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It emphasizes the divinity of Christ, the authority of the Church, and the unity of believers under orthodox doctrine.

celtic_pagan_DESC;Rooted in the sacred groves, misty hills, and ancient stone circles of the Celts, this faith venerates a pantheon of deities tied to nature, war, and the cycles of life and death. Druids serve as spiritual guides, mediating between mortals and the divine through ritual, sacrifice, and prophecy. Sacred animals, holy wells, and seasonal festivals hold deep importance, marking the eternal balance between fertility and the harvest, war and peace, life and the Otherworld. Though fragmented in practice, Celtic Paganism is bound by reverence for the land, the ancestors, and the ever-present spirits that dwell beyond mortal sight.;;;;;;;;;x
