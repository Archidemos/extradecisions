germanic_pagan_DESC;The old faith of the Germanic tribes venerates a pantheon led by powerful gods such as Wodan, Donar, and Frigg. Warriors seek the favor of the gods through courage, oathkeeping, and blood sacrifice, believing that glory in battle ensures a place in the halls of the honored dead. Sacred groves, runic rites, and seasonal festivals bind the community together in devotion to the old ways, resisting the encroachment of foreign faiths.;;;;;;;;;x

nicene_christian_DESC;Founded on the teachings of Jesus Christ and the doctrine defined at the First Council of Nicaea, this faith proclaims one God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It emphasizes the divinity of Christ, the authority of the Church, and the unity of believers under orthodox doctrine.
