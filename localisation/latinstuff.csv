EVTNAMELATIN1;The Fall of Byzantium;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLATIN1;Hark, Rulers of the Catholic world! Rejoice, as the mighty Crusaders have taken the Eternal city of Constantinople from the pretenders who have held it for too long. With the New emperor being coronated in the newly converted Hagia Sophia, the Crusades shall now be able to continue with no interference on the way to the holy land. The next step now is to expel all remaning influence of the remnant empire. By the Grace of God, and the virgin Mary;;;;;;;;;;;x
