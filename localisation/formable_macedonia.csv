form_macedonia_desc;For many centuries, our Ancient Greek traditions have been lost long ago by the Roman Empire. However now that the Eastern Roman Empire is weakened, perhaps this is the time to declare that the Legacy of Alexander the Great has been reborn.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMAKED.100;The Legacy of Argead;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAKED.100;At last, after many internal and external conflicts against the Eastern Roman Empire, it seems that the Greek states has taken this turmoil as oppertunity and succeeded to reunite the Kingdom of the Argeadian Macedonia. The fate of the Eastern Roman Religion is now in the hands of the newly formed Macedonian Kingdom, who knows perhaps they will also turn to their old Hellenic Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMAKED.101;The Greek Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAKED.101;Now that we have united the important Greek lands, we have to also liberate all the other Greeks within the Eastern Roman Empire. It is now or never to free them from Roman influence. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTMAKED.1;Down with the Romans!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMAKED.2;Now is not the time... yet.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMAKED.102;A call from the Past;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAKED.102;Sire, It seems that the newly formed Maceondian Kingdom has risen up against the Eastern Roman Empire. This could be a chance to get our independence and be free of our centuries long Roman Overlords. However, we could also remain loyal to the Eastern Roman Empire. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMAKED.3;Down with the Roman Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMAKED.4;No, we are loyal Romans!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMAKED.103;The Greek Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAKED.103;It seems that the Greeks have started a Rebelion against your rule. They wish to restore the Macedonian Empire by removing the influence of the Roman Empire and undo the conquest of Julius Ceasar. This is concerning news as this is a direct war next to the Capital while the Greek lands are our richest possesion yet. We must do something about this and crush this rebelion at once before its too late. We will not lose the Roman Empire to our subjects!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMAKED.5;For the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMAKED.104;The Roman Eagle falls;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAKED.104;We have finally won, after many battle against our own brothers that would go against our freedom. We have finally suceeded in liberating our Greek lands. These cowards took our lands while we were struggling ourselfs, no honor. However, since we currently are in the Imperial Palace and currently hold the title of Eastern Roman Emperor, to finalize our rebelion, we shall take this "title" and shatter it to the ground and throw it away like dirt after we are done establishing the Greco-Anatolian Kingdoms. If Alexander the Great was alive, he would have been proud of our achievement. Now that we have liberated our Greek brothers in Europe but also in Anatolia, it is time to divide responsibilities and crown new kings that shall rule parts of Anatolia while we shall keep Greece itself.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTMAKED.6;For Argead!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMAKED.6SPECIAL;The Duchy of Thrace shall be transfered to the De-Jure of Macedonia while the Kingdoms of Trebizond and Anatolia will be established while all the other Duchies will be set free and the Eastern Roman Empire will be destroyed and the De Jure of it will be replaced with the Empire of Macedonia;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMAKED.108;The Fallen Eagle;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAKED.108;It has been told that the Eastern Roman Empire is no longer. After a major conflict with the Greeks that eventually led to war, it seems that the Greeks actually won against the Empire by all odds. New Greek Kingdoms are established while all the other remaining Greek Dukes will be set free.;;;;;;;;;;;x

GREEK_REVOLTER_WINS;The Eastern Roman Empire will be forfeit and the preperations to free all the Greeks and to establish new Greek Kingdoms shall begin. As for the Emperor himself, he will be arrested and thrown into the dungeon while being at your mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GREEK_REVOLTER_LOSES;The Eastern Roman Emperor will reabsorb its rebellious vassals and will put them in jail, the Macedonian Kingdom will be no more and the Kingdom of Greece will get its De-Jure back.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMAKED.106;The End of the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAKED.106;As we have been defeated and the Greeks have entered the Imperial Palace, we have no choice but to let them do as they want with the Empire. There is no way out of this anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;x
