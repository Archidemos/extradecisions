EVTDESCSJK.60207;As a Seljuk, it is my rights to conquer for our Turkish ancestors and establish a Turkish Empire. Yet, I feel compelled to integrate myself with our Persian subjects, as they have a long and mighty history which must be respected and proclaiming myself Persian will herald a new Persian Empire, thus leaving my Turkish heritage behind. I am not sure what to do.;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTOPTASJK.60207;I will embrace my new Persian identity, a new Persian Empire will be proclaimed!;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTOPTBSJK.60207;I will not give up my Turkish roots, the Seljuk's are Turks first and foremost.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSJK.60208;I am the Seljuk Sultan, it is my right to emphasise the Seljuk Empire.;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTOPTASJK.60208;I lead to the Seljuk Turks!;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESCSJK.60601;One of my relatives has decided to form his own Sultanate in Asia Minor in order to pursue his own agenda as the new Sultan of Rum and has taken the territories in Asia Minor for himself.;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTOPTASJK.60601;Let him go, he can do what he wants.;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTOPTBSJK.60601;He is a Seljuk and will obey me!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSJK.60209;The great Turkic leader, Seljuk, started the great dynasty of his name and lead it to greatness. Now, however, the Seljuk’s no longer control of their own realm. This has caused a breakdown in loyalties from those who were loyal to the Seljuk’s and no-one else. As a result, their realm is collapsing in on itself leaving us with little to no measure of control.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASJK.60209;This is not good.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
