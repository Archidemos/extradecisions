MOGGOLDCLASH.100;Golden Horde Envoy;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOGGOLDCLASHDESC.100;Great Khan, we have recived a envoy from our Mongolian brothers of the west. The Golden Horde wishes to make peace with you. It seems that they are offering as far as tribute to you as long as we promise to aid them whenver they are in dire need and to not attack them. What shall we respond with Great Khan?;;;;;;;;;;;x

MOGGOLDCLASH.101;Mongolic-Golden Horde Pact;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOGGOLDCLASHDESC.101;As the two massive Hordes are laying waste to the lands of the World. There has been contact between the Golden Horde and the Mongol Empire. It seems that they are related to eachother and therefore wish to keep the peace between the two Empires. In order for that to happen, the Golden Horde agreed to pledge some of their treasury and income to the Mongol Empire, in exchange of eternal peace. This is be catastrophic for Europe as now, the Golden Horde, already on the footsteps of Europe are now able to conquer and raze freely without having to worry about the Mongols.;;;;;;;;;;;x

MOGILLCLASH.100;Ilkhanate Envoy;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOGILLCLASHDESC.100;Great Khan, we have recived a envoy from our Mongolian brothers from Persia. The Ilkhanate also wishes to make peace with you. It seems that they are offering as far as tribute to you as long as we promise to aid them whenver they are in dire need and to not attack them. What shall we respond with Great Khan?;;;;;;;;;;;x

MOGILLCLASH.101;Mongolic-Ilkhanate Horde Pact;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOGILLCLASHDESC.101;As the Ilkhanate, being related to the Mongol Empire also have the goald to lay waste to the world to assert Tengri dominations towards the lands the Ilkhanate conquers. Because of this ambition, there has been contact between the Ilkhanate and the Mongol Empire. It seems that the Mongol Empire admire the ambitions of the Ilkhanate and therefore wish to keep the peace between the two Empires. In order for that to happen, the Ilkhanate agreed to pledge some of their treasury and income to the Mongol Empire, in exchange of eternal peace. This is be catastrophic for Anatolia and the Balkans and maybe for Europe in the futureas now, the Ilkhanate have free regin to conquer and raze freely without having to worry about the Mongols.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEILKH105;The City of Peace;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCILKH105;Long have we traveled trough-out Asia, we have seen many thing. From our homeland in Mongolia, we traveled to the India where we have seen the Elephants and their culture all the way to where we are now, Persia. Within Persia there are so many beautifull things about it like the culture and their prized city, Baghdad. Perhaps it is time to make a decision. We could choose to keep the prosperous and rich city of Baghdad, the "City of Peace" and start settling arround the area to assert our presence to prosper and perhaps keep peace. However we could also choose to keep going west and continue practicing our traditions by staying Nomadic and lay waste to the whole world in the name of Tengri...;;;;;;;;;;;x

ILKHOPT1;It is time to stay in Persia;;;;;;;;;;;x
ILKHOPT2;On wards, to Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEILKH106;The Ilkhanate settles in Iraq;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCILKH106;We recieved gladning news in Persia, word goes that the Ilkhanate, a group of Nomads that has seperated from the Mongol Empire to help out with laying waste and its conquest, have finally decided to settle in Persia. This was announced in their new capital of Baghdad, where they will consolidate their influence, religion and power over all of Persia. However, this does not mean that they will stop there. However, this does tame the Mongolian Horde of the Ilkhanate quite alot. We shall hope that this is the last time we will hear from them..;;;;;;;;;;;x

create_russia_gold;Create the Mongol State of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;x
create_russia_gold_desc;The Russian lands seems to be too challenging to govern my ourselfs as we have better things to do than to stay in Russia. Perhaps its wise to release a loyal Russian Mongol State that will answer our every call in case we need the extra men;;;;;;;;;;;x

ILKHOPT3;Let them settle at last..;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEGOL105;The Mongol State of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGOL105;Russia is a massive piece of land with many kinds of people living within it. This however did not stop the Golden Horde to conquer the lands. However, it proves to even the Golden Horde to be too much to control. Hence why the Golden Horde decided to release the Empire of Russia under the control of the Golden Horde. This could be a great way to mobilize the army in Russia and call them in any conflict that the Golden Horde may be in. Regardless of this benefit, this could act as a double-edged sword as the Russians could easily turn away from the Golden Horde. Only time will tell what will happen further in the Russian lands;;;;;;;;;;;x

GOLDOPT1;Wonderfull;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMETIME105;The City of Half of the World;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIME105;We have at last reached the City of Half of the World, Esfahan. A Magnificent city with quite the beauty. Too bad that we will have to continue our march to reunify the Empire of the Mongols. We do have a choice however, we can keep our traditions and stay the way we are, or use Esfahan as a base for our new reformed Empire and Feudalize to the Iqta ways. If we Feudalize, we are able to make better use of the urbanized cities of the Middle East to our advantage, from getting more finances to being able to mobilize the local armies. This however means, abandoning our traditional way of living. What shall we choose?;;;;;;;;;;;x

TIMEOPT1;We will follow the way of Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIMEOPT2;We will keep our traditions and move forward!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMETIME106;The Timurids settles in Persia;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIME106;Releaving news, it seems that after the Timurids have reached Esfahan, they have started to feudalize and adopted the Iqta way of governing lands. This means that they abandoned their Mongolic and Barbaric ways of conquering and are perhaps more pacified. This however doesnt mean that they will just stop from Persia... or perhaps they will. Only time will tell what Timurds will do as their leader, Timur the Lame can be a monster. Perhaps he changed his ways, only God can show ur mercy now..;;;;;;;;;;;x

TIMEOPT3;May Timur find peace now;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCILKH108;We have got bad news, it seems that our rival clan, the Qara Qoyunlu is attempting to take down our empire by declaring a full scale invasion on us. This is grim news and we have to stop them at once!;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIMEOPT10;To War!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMETIME111;The Qara Qoyunlu;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTIME111;Word goes arround that the mighty Timurids got defeated by the newly risen horde of the Qara Qoyunlu. This horde originated from the Timurids and figured to grab a chance at toppling the Timurid Empire, and it seems that they succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIMEOPT11;Awfull!;;;;;;;;;;;x
