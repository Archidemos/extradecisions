Portugal is similarily to Castille, on the verge of swithing dynasties. When the last duke of Portugal died he passed the crown to his wife while his son was still growing up, will these French up-starts in Portugal make it out alive against the strongest Muslim foe the peninsula has witnessed in centuries?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
