HREARNAME1;The Imperial Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HREDESC1;At last, your father Louis the Pious has died after living a longer life then most people in the World. You now have to decide what to do with the Empire. You can perhaps assume control over Louis's Throne and keep his Empire together or you could shatter the Holy Roman Empire and let your brother go. What shall we do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTHREAR.1;It is time to end this Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHREAR.2;Louis's Legacy shall live on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HREARNAME2;Louis's Legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HREDESC2;You have decided to keep the Empire together, as much as this is preferable to maintain your current power. This will anger your brothers and vassals alike, therefore you will have to deal with a few problems that the Empire will bring with you. Either you maintain control, or you will splinter at last. May God be on your side, Louis will be watching from Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHREAR.5;In the name of God, Louis and Charlemagne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HREARNAME3;The Crown of Louis Shattered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HREDESC3;It is no suprise that Louis's Empire would end when he would die. Louis lived a long life which is unheard of, however at last he lost his life. After the Crown passed to his Son, it seems that the Ambitious King has decided to Dismantle the Empire that his Father and Grandfather have build. Therefore, The Holy Roman Empire is gone... but for how long..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHREAR.3;Europe is restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HREARNAME4;The Imperial Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HREDESC4;This has come to a suprise to everyone in Europe. It seems that after the death of Louis the Pious, his son would keep the title of Holy Roman Emperor. This could bring a whole lot of conflicts as all the Kingdoms within the Holy Roman Empire is held by his brothers which are very displeased of this succession. Only time will tell what will happen to this Ancient Empire that has lasted after the Collapse of the Roman Empire. Perhaps, there is a small chance that his son could stabilize the Empire and deal with the internal conflicts. Only time will tell what will happen to the empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHREAR.4;Hah, there is no chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HREARNAME12;Imperial Crisis averted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HREDESC12;This is unbelievable. News has spread that the Holy Roman Empire has resolved their crisis and stabalized everything within the Empire. It seems like the Empire of Charlemagne will stand tall after all. If Louis the Pious were to be alive, he would surely be proud of his grandchildren. While they rejoice, the rest of Europe watches with evny and fear as this massive Empire will surely last troughout the ages. God only knows what their next ambition is;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
