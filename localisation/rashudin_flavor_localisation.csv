ANNORASHD.100;The Islamic Conquest of Iraq;;;;;;;;;;;x
ANNORASHDDESC.100;It seems that the newly risen Caliphate for the religion called Islam have beaten the mighty Sassanid and Eastern Roman Empire in one battle.

ANNORASHD.101;The Ghassanids have been defeated;;;;;;;;;;;x
ANNORASHDDESC.101;Without catching a break, it seems that the Ghassanids have been defeated. They have been recent friends of the Eastern Roman Empire and have always gotten aid from them.

ANNORASHD.110;The Final Stretch towards Hispania;;;;;;;;;;;x
ANNORASHDDESC.110;Indeed, from where this was seen as a major raid towards the Eastern Roman Empire. It now seems that this new Empire or Caliphate has conquered their way to the Kingdom of Spain. Surely, at some point, even for this miraculous-like Empire, there is a breaking point for having this much land... Their Empire extends from the Gates of India all the way to the Heart of Hispania. Perhaps this marks as the end of the Conquest, or maybe they will conquer deeper into Europe... Only time will tell what the Caliphate will do next...;;;;;;;;;;;x

ANNORASHDDESC200;As figured, this newly risen Caliphate in Arabia got beaten after the Sassanids and the Eastern Roman Empire formed a Coalition against these Arabian Raiders after they have launched a massive invasion against both Empires.

EVTDESCRASHD114;Bad News, it seems that our recently banished free-man called Abu Muslim have gathered quite the support in Persia to start a rebellion against us. They have raised black banners and are proclaiming the Abbasid Caliphate naming after their own dynasty called the Abbasids. Apperently, we are too harsh to anyone except our own people but this is redicilous! None the less, this is an alarming problem and we have to deal with this at once, before he gains more power.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMERASHD115;The Final Bastion;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCRASHD115;My Caliph, it seems that we have not yet defeated the Visigothics just yet. After our conquest in Hispania, they took some of the land we have taken from them and they use the mountains of Northen Hispania. As they have established themselfs, they have continously raided our caravans and harrashed our garrisons on the border. We have to put an end to this before it could affect us bad in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;x

ANNORASHD116;The Final Bastion;;;;;;;;;;;x
ANNORASHDDESC116;As the Caliphate has conquered all of Hispania, it seems the Visigoths have not yet given up and have established a small realm on the mountains of Northen Hispania. Christianity in Hispania is not yet defeated, time will tell what they will do nextThe Final Bastion;;;;;;;;;;;x
