What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCEL.002;Send an diplomat to the Papacy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECEL.106;The Holy Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCEL.106;Concerning news, it seems that the Holy See is at war against the Celtic Empire. It looks like the Celtic Empire wants to usurp the Papacy and install the Insular Church on Rome.
