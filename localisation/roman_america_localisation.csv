EVTNAMEROMA97;Strange Red Fleet Spotted;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMA97;A very strange sight has been spotted, it seems that across the Atlantic Ocean, a massive fleet has been spotted by Nordic and English Merchant Ships. This is very weird since we always knew that part of the Ocean to be the End of the World, where the ocean would flood down to the void. Perhaps... there is land out there, or worse. Who knows where this fleet came from, however the biggest concern is that it is slowly approaching Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROMA99;Golden Eagles on the Horrizon;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMA99;As months have passed, English scouts and traveling Merchant Ships have been able to take a closer look at the fleet. We got told that the ships seems to be using red sails with mostly a yellow eagles on it. While the ships themselfs look not from this time. Its like the ships that were build in Ancient Rome... This is not making up as the Roman Empire have been disintregrated for centuries now. Whatever waits on those ships dont look too friendly as within the ship, they seem to be armed and weaponized. This is very concerning.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROMA100;The Roman Invasion for England;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMA100;At last, these fantasized warriors that were across the sea within the ships are actual Romans. There is massive confusion within the whole of Europe since this is not making sense. Theories are already being made like this being the Wrath of God, or that these are Warriors from an Unknown World.. The only logical explanation given by historians and our wise people seems to be that perhaps during the Fall of the Roman Empire, they fled with the leftover ships towards whereever they came from and now came back for revenge. Eitherway they seem to want to have a fight and we must stop these Romans before it is too late!;;;;;;;;;;;x
