form_west_rome_desc;The title of Western Rome has been destroyed for a long time now after the cowardice spit Eastern Roman Empire, the West being conquered by the Germanic Barbarians. However, after many victories and gathering the ancient people of Rome. It is time to proclaim the title of Western Roman Emperor!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.100;West Rome Reborn;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.100;It must be a miracle, after hundereds of years, West Rome has united once more after many hardships from the fall of West Rome to the complete disapearance of the Roman people within Italia. At last the Ruler of Italia has gathered the Roman people and have found its Legitimacy trough them to declare himself Ceasar of West Rome;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.001;Ave, Ceasar!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.101;West Rome Reborn;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.101;After so long, we have finaly claimed the title of Rome trough our legit claim and with the help of the Roman people that we have gathered and resettled within Italia. Now it is time to act against the Byzantines that refused to send proper aid when the west was crumbling. We will demand them to make our claim true and legit!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.002;Send the Envoy!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.003;We dont need their aproval!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.102;An Envoy from Rome;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.102;This is the first time after centuries, an envoy that came from Imperial Rome. After the formation of Rome, it seems that West Rome seeks our approval to their legitimacy. This is redicilous however it might have its benifits to have them arround. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.004;Rome has been reborn!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.005;We shall not help these pretenders!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.103;The Preparation;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.103;Good news, the Byzantines have agreed to acknowledge our claim to Rome and are willing to prepare a coronation for the new born Roman Eagle of the West;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.006;Time to make a proposition with the Byzantines;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.104;The act against the Byzantines;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.104;At last, bad news. The Byzantines have refused our request and called us the pretenders of Rome, this great insult shall not be left away. We have to act, before our claim to Rome will be seen as a mere joke. What shall we do against the Byzantines..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.008;Then we shall take our Eastern part back!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.009;We will make them pay!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.010;There is nothing we can do;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.105;Rome's Claim on their lost lands;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.105;News has spread that the Byzantines have insulted the newly formed Rome and rejected their claim to it. This has angered the Western Roman Empire to the extent where they went on and get a claim on the Byzantine throne, having the excuse they need to perhaps unify the empires together once more..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.011;This could be bad news..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.106;Rome's Revenge on the Byzantines;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.106;News has spread that the Byzantines have insulted the newly formed Rome and rejected their claim to it. This has angered the Western Roman Empire and are now marching towards the Byzantines to make them pay and to Subjugate them by making the Byzantines pay tribute and to also make the Byzantine army pledge to the Roman cause..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.012;Concerning..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.107;The Eagle falls once again;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.107;At last, news has spread that after the Byzantines insuled Rome and rejected their claim. Rome was unable to do anything about it in which at this point their claim is beeing seen as a joke to all the other Euoprean Kingdoms and Empires alike. This has put a mark on the newly formed Empire and make them unconditionally relinquish their title and claim to Rome completly..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.013;Peace at last!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.108;Unification of Rome;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.108;While preparing for the Coronation of the Western Romans, their ruler has presented us a proposal. They are aware that the Muslims in the east always caused trouble to the Byzantines and they also know that they could become a bigger threat in the future. Hence why the Western Roman Emperor has proposed a Union between the two, they claim that perhaps restoring Rome would be the best thing to do in order to restore Rome's Glory once more. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.014;We shall unite once more, for Rome!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.015;How about we pledge with our wealth and power only..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.016;This is outrageous, we refuse!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.109;Rome United once more;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.109;It has happend, after more than 200 years the two Roman eagles have finally decided to reunite their borders and reform Rome to its former glory. To some this is amazing news while for the others, this might be very concerning. Who will be able to stop the Roman Eagle..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.017;May the strongest survive...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.110;Roman-Byzantine Cooperation;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.110;It seems that there was an attempt to restore the borders of the Roman Empire again, however this did not succeed. The Byzantines claimed that they simply cannot just give in to the Romans like that. However they did pledge their wealth and army to the Roman cause. Rome has many enemies even untill today, and this semi-union can cause great things for the Romans. However it does seem that this will cause future problem for when they perhaps are thinking on restoring Rome...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.018;God have mercy..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.111;Western Roman Victory;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.111;The news has spread everywhere in Europe, the Western Roman Empire has won a decisive war against the Byzantines. The Western Romans were able to march towards Constantinople and press their demands onto the Byzantines Emperor. Now all the Byzantines can do is follow their demands and give in to the new Western Roman Empire;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.019;This is bad..;;;;;;;;;x


EVTNAMEROM.112;The fall of Western Rome;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.112;Rumors say that the newly formed Western Roman Empire has lost a decisive battle against the Byzantines, leaving the Western Roman Empire with nothing. This means that the Byzantines now are freely able to march onto Rome and making the Romans lose their claim. At last the Roman Crisis has been resolved in Byzantine Dominance. All the Western Roman Empire can do now is to give in to the Byzantine demands and lose their Empire once more. This time however, by their own Roman brother in the east..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.020;Europe is safe once more..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.115;The Western Roman Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.115;An envoy from the Western Roman Empire has arrived, it seems that they demanded us to give up and destory the title of Holy Roman Emperor. As much of a insult this is to us, we have to consider our people as well. This war could end up very bloody weither we win or lose. What shall we do..?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.023;We have no choice but to agree..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.024;These Romans are making me laugh!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.116;The Emperor agrees;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.116;At last, The Holy Roman Emperor has come with the envoy we have sent. It seems that the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire is prepared to give up his title to us. This is great news as the faith of the Holy Roman Empire is in our hands, but we know what we will do about this pretentious title!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.025;At last, The Holy Roman Empire no more!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.117;The Emperor refuses!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.117;The Envoy has come back empty handed. It seems that the Emperor is not willing to give in to our demand. Perhaps we should think about our next action as the Holy Roman Empire is no joke, they are a mighty German Empire that should not be underestimated. What shall we do about the pretenders..?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.026;Then war it is!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.027;Perhaps this is not smart..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.118;The Fallen Pretenders;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.118;The rumors were true. It seems that the Holy Roman Empire exists no longer. After the defeat of the Holy Roman Army, Western Rome was able to march on to the Imperial Capital of the Empire with little resistance. From the throne room, the Western Roman Emperor has at last disolved the Holy Roman Empire;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.028;Gone with the Germans!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.119;Holy Roman Victory;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.119;How humiliating. Rumors go that the Western Roman Empire lost against the Holy Roman Empire, after the West Romans have sent a deligation towards the Holy Roman Empire to disolve the Title of the Holy Roman Empire. After the Emperor refused, Western Rome went to war but lost at last against the Holy Roman Empire. This is truly a shame for the Roman Emperor;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.029;The embarrasment..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.120;The Western Roman Usurpation;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.120;This is unheard of. The Holy Roman Empire has traveled to Rome to meet up with the Western Roman Emperor. Rumor goes that the Holy Roman Emperor has given their titles to the Western Roman Emperor in which they have disolved and destroyed the title of the Holy Roman Empire. Perhaps the Holy Roman Emperor had good reasonings behind this but this is a shame to the Germans and the Catholic world;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTROM.030;Roman no longer..;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEROM.121;The Aftermath;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROM.121;Sire, we have finally beaten the Holy Roman Empire. For so long, they have been claiming to be the sucessor to Rome but thanks to you. Their claims are no longer valid, we truly are the Heirs of the Roman Empire now.;;;;;;;;;x
