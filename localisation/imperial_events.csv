T_GGH2;Guelphs and Ghibbelines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH2;After the passing of the Concordat of Worms by the Salian Kings, the newly elected Kaiser has appointed the primate back to himself.\n\nIn reaction to this a new faction is forming by the outraged vassals. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH2;Frightening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A_GGH3;We shall stand by the Holy See.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
B_GGH3;My interests lay in the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
C_GGH3;This isn't my fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH200;Guelphs and Ghibbelines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH200;I've come to the conclusion that it might be the time for me to pick a side within this internal conflict. Now is only the choice which side do I take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH200;The Guelphs have my support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
B_GGH200;The Ghibbelines have my support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
C_GGH200;Actually, nevermind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH201;Leaders of the Factions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH201;Here are the Guelph and Ghibbeline leaders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH201;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH205;To Arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH205;I'm calling you to arms in the struggle against the Emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH205;Raise my banner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH300;Victory in the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH300;With the defeat of the last Imperial forces, the conclusion to the Guelph and Ghibbeline struggles has finally been realised. After many clashes the winning side finally gets to decide over the law of land, most importantly the investiture of the empire.\n\nWith political opponents imprisoned surely this status quo will last?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH402;Dictatus Papae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH402;The Pope has foolishly declared himself to be above all the physical leaders of the world. Perhaps he should learn what it is to kiss someone's boot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH402;Send him my regards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH410;Imperial Fortune;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH410;The lazy pope has yet to interfere with my power, perhaps he is plotting something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH410;Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH411;Excommunication;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH411;The HRE has set up an anti-pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH411;Banish him from the church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH412;Excommunication;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH412;The Pope has brazenly decided to excommunicated me! If I don't fix this fast my rulership will fall apart as people will count me as an illigitemate ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH412;I'll have to reason with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
B_GGH412;Time to knock on the doors of St. Peter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH413;Repentance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH413;The Holy Roman Emperor wants to repent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH413;Hell NAH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH414;At the doors of Canossa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH414;After I located his Holiness to be staying at Matilda's residence in Canossa, I pursued him to beg for forgiveness. However when I did so all he had to offer me was this hairy cloak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH414;What a jerk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH415;Back to communion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH415;The Holy See has finally granted me the right to come back to church! Hopefully my authority will come back to me…!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH415;I need a bath…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH420;Saxon Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH420;The Emperor has lost his rights to rule over us with his excommunication by the Holy See. Now's our time to strike at him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH420;Forwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH421;Saxon Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH421;The Emperor has lost his rights to rule over us with his excommunication by the Holy See. Now's our time to strike at him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH421;Forwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
B_GGH421;I'll stay out of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH422;Saxon Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH422;Rebellious vassals have rebelled in my absence and excommunicated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH422;Damn you Saxons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_HRE106;The Imperial Bloodline;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_HRE106;[Root.GetBestName] has succeeded in the centralisation of the Empire. [Root.GetHerHis] renown and respect spreading all through the land, both domestic and foreign. Kings and Queens all adhere to [Root.GetHerHim] and foreign rulers look up to you.\n\nIn your many years as [Root.GetEmperorEmpress] [Root.GetBestName] has built up and grown the Empire both economically and military, proving the Empire to be now one of the main players within the world stage. Setting sights on territories to conquer and integrate either by diplomacy or by the sword.\n\nIt is without a doubt that the Empire will even outgrow it's currect power status and forever leave it mark on the annals of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_HRE106;Long Live the [Root.GetEmperorEmpress], and their descendants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_HRE110;Improved Authority;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_HRE110;The local lords have been corresponding and adhering to my authority more often. This points to an increase in my power towards my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_HRE110;Splendid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_HRE113;Deprecated Authority;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_HRE113;A lapse in the bureaucracy within the realm has caused me to lose on taxes and levies, leading to a steadily decline in control and authority in those regions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_HRE113;Shame;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T_GGH500;The Shaken Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_GGH500;With the victory of the Guelphs over the Ghibbelines, and my ascension to throne of the Holy Roman Empire, it has become evident that the Empire was left in fractured state after the wars.\n\nMany of the Guelphs ask for autonomy or independence, Italians compromising a large quantity of them, however my subjects back in Germany disagree with such course of action ask seek to establish new conflicts.\n\nIt is up to me to decide the fate of the Empire within a short while or there could be consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_GGH500;It was never Holy, Roman nor an Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
B_GGH500;I will continue the tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
