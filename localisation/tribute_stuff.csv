EVTNAMETRIB.1;An Envoy from our Overlord;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTRIB.1;Sire, we have some grim news. It seems that the envoy sent here from our Overlord has a message about the Annexation of these realms. It seems that our Overlord wishes us to continue ruling our realm but within his grasp. He wishes that we join his realm while keeping the land we own. This means that we will be integrated within his realm. Perhaps this could be a good thing as we are easier able to grow within his realm, however this also means that we will lose our Independence. What shall we do now?;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTTRIB.1;Very well, we shall cooperate;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTRIB.2;This is insane, never!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMETRIB.2;A Rebelious Subject;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTRIB.2;Sire, we got concerning news. We have just recieved the envoy of our Subject and they declare to not be incorperated and goes against your wishes. If we do not act, this means that they will become free of our grasp... unless you put this rebelion down at once. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTTRIB.3;They will bow down to me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTRIB.4;We got no choice;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMETRIB.3;Independence;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTRIB.3;Good news sire, our envoy has just returned with news that our Overlord has decided to let us go. This means that we are Independent once again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
